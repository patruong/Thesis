# 2. The basic biology of proteomics.
Proteomics is the study of proteins and thier part in the biological systems. In modern medicin the field of proteomics has a great importance to understanding disease markers for diagnosis and therapy monitoring, as the proteome reflect more accurately on the dynamic state of a cell, tissue or organsm than the genome ([Cho. W. 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5054093/)). The advent of proteomics technology and bioinformatics techniques has presented novel opportunities to explore biological systems and further understanding of diseases. In this chapter, a background in the field of molecular biology related to proteomics will be presented.

## Transcriptom, genome and thier relationship to the proteome

## Proteins
## Proteoform 
Protein variation account for a substantial amount of complexity in a biological system. These variations are called proteoforms. It has been shown that a lot of the complexity in biology us caused by protein rather than only genes. 

# The field of proteomics and its technology.
[EDIT ITS COPY PASTED]
Mass spectrometry plays a vital role in proteomics and has become an indispensable tool for molecular and cellular biology ([Cho. W. 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5054093/)).

# Challenges in proteomics
[EDIT ITS COPY PASTED, Cho. W 2007 is about the challenges read it!]
While the potential is great, many challenges and issues remain to be solved, such as mining low abundant proteins and integration of proteomics with genomics and metabolomics data. Nevertheless, proteomics is the foundation for constructing and extracting useful knowledge to biomedical research. In this review, a snapshot of contemporary issues in proteomics technologies is discussed.([Cho. W. 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5054093/))
