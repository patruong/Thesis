# The basic biology of proteomics.
Proteomics is the study of proteins and thier part in the biological systems. In modern medicin the field of proteomics has a great importance to understanding disease markers for diagnosis and therapy monitoring, as the proteome reflect more accurately on the dynamic state of a cell, tissue or organsm than the genome [Cho.

## Genes
## Proteins
## Proteoform 
Protein variation account for a substantial amount of complexity in a biological system. These variations are called proteoforms. It has been shown that a lot of the complexity in biology us caused by protein rather than only genes.
